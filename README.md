refugeemap (mapugee )
=======

Interactive tempo-spatial flow map based on UNHCR data. 
Please note that this is a prototype, not running fully stable.
The resulting maps or charts can be wrong! Don't rely on the information.

The application is based on D3, TopoJSON, jQuery and jQueryUI. 
A database server and php is needed to serve the UNHCR database.
Use grunt to build a working copy. 

Features at current stage:

 * Complete integration of the official UNHCR database.
 * Tools for tempo-spatial subsets.
 * Various tools to filter the data displayed on the map.
 * Different map-projections.
 * Animation with adjustable speed.
