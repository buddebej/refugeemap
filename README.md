refugeemap (mapugee )
=======

Interactive tempo-spatial flow map based on UNHCR data. 
Please note that this is a prototype, not running fully stable.
The resulting maps or charts can be wrong! Don't rely on the information.

The application is based on D3, TopoJSON, jQuery and jQueryUI. 
A database server and php is needed to serve the UNHCR database.
Use grunt to build a working copy. 

A working demo is available [here](http://mapugee.boeppe.eu/)
